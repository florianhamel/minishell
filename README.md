# minishell

A shell that behaves like bash with less functionalities.

Work in progress - for the moment, it only gets the command line typed, and has a working history.

To run it:
- Use `Make` and `./minishell`
- You can use side arrows to navigate through the command line and up/down arrows to navigate through the history
- `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + D` work

Minishell is a 42 project made in C.
