# minishell

A shell that behaves like bash with less functionalities.

Work in progress - a few features still need to implemented.

To run it:
- Use a UNIX based system (`MacOS` or `Linux` for example)
- Clone this repository
- Use `make` and `./minishell` inside the repository
- You can use side arrows to navigate through the command line and up/down arrows to navigate through the history
- `ctrl` + `C` and `ctrl` + `D` work the same as in bash
- The implemented builtins are `exit` `cd ` `pwd` `export` `unset` `env` and `echo` 

minishell is a 42 project.
